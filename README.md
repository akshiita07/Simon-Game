# Simon-Game
The Simon game is a classic memory game where the player must repeat increasingly long sequences of colors and sounds generated by the game. Each round, the game adds a new color to the sequence, and the player must recall and click the colors in the correct order. The game progresses to higher levels as long as the player continues to correctly repeat the sequences. If the player makes a mistake, the game ends and can be restarted. It is implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
